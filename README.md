# playlist-port
A simple script to transfer your amazon music playlist to spotify.

One fine day my dear friend <a href="https://github.com/paxF3E">Pallav</a> asked me to send him a playlist of Rock Ballads (since I am a rock fan).
But I use Amazon Music for listening music (don't judge me I have a free subscription) and he uses Spotify, and neither of us lazy asses were going to search all those songs
and add them to a playlist. So I did what I can do best, wrote a code.
Just putting this here for all (though scarce) Amazon Music users who have friends who use Spotify :)
